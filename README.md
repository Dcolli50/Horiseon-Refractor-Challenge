#Background
This project is my attempt of refactoring Horiseon's existing website code to make it more accesible, through HTML5 and CSS best practice, and meeting the acceptance criteria as shown below. Comments were added throughout both HTML and CSS files, highlighting the improved semantic structure and changes.
